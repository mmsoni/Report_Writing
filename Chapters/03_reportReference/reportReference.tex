\section{Introduction Turbulence modelling}

{\bf i DNS}.\\
Direct numerical simulation (DNS) method uses a modelling-free approach for approximation of the exact solution, as the navier-stokes equation comprises of all turbulence mechanisms. Since the turbulence is three dimensional and inherently instationary it has to take in to account all the components present in the navier stokes equation.Turbulence involves the interaction in between the scales of various different sizes and thus to represnt the exact solution or the characteristics of the turbulent flow considered correctly, the DNS method emphasises on the fine spatial and temporal resolution of the meshes. Apart from that this method requires the discretization methods to have low level of numerical dissipation and dispersion. In order to correctly determine the effects of the turbulence intensity, the fluctuating flow variables which satisfy the navier stokes equation are provided as inputs.
\\
{\bf ii DES}.\\
Detached eddy simulation, DES, combines the approach of RANS and the LES method; it therefore belongs to the class of the hybrid RANS-LES simulations. The basic idea of this method is that the near wall boundary layer would be resolved using the RANS approach, while the usuage of LES to (correctly) resolve such regions requires a very fine spatial and temporal resolution, as the turbulent scales to be resolved in the boundary layers are very small. On the other hand, the detached regions, wakes and the free shear layers are the regions, where the RANS model frequently fails, are handled by the LES.\\
\\
 DES was first introduced by {\it Spalart et al.}. The goal was to compute the aerodynamic flows involving massive seperation with a moderate increase in the grid resolution compared to the RANS method. The idea behind the DES is to segregate the flow, using suitable detectors, in to the domains where the entire energy spectrum will be modelled using the RANS (near wall boundary layer) or the large energy containing structures are resolved using the LES method (detached flow region). Therefore in this approach, a suitable method is chosen, for each domain, in terms of efficiency and accuracy.\\
\\
In comparison with LES, for the computation of the flows involving the boundary layer, DES reduces the computational effort significantly. Since the flows involved are unsteady and three dimensional turbulent flows, the computational effort will be relatively higher when compared with RANS.\\

Avery good compilation of the hybrid RANS-LES approach is found in {\it Fr√∂hlich and von Tersi (2008)}\\


\begin{equation}
\label{eddy-viscosity-conditioning}
\begin{split}
A^{3/2} &= \left({S_{ij}^{d}}{S_{ij}^{d}}\right)^{3/2},\\ A^{5/4} &= \left({S_{ij}^{d}}{S_{ij}^{d}}\right)^{5/4},\\ B^{5/2} &= \left(\sij \sij\right)^{5/2}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
When terms of the equation ~\ref{eddy-viscosity-conditioning} are replaced in the equation for ~\ref{eddy-viscosity} it looks as follows (not considering $\epsilon$ now):
\begin{equation}
\label{eddy-viscosity-changed}
\begin{split}\\
{\nu_t} &= \left({C_w}{\Delta}\right)^{2}
\frac{A^{3/2}}{B^{5/2} + {A^{5/4}}},\\
{OP} &= \frac{A^{3/2}}{B^{5/2} + {A^{5/4}}}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}\\
Now in the equation ~\ref{eddy-viscosity-changed} let's divide by ${A^{5/4}}$ and ${OP}$ would like:
\begin{equation}
\label{some_modification}
\begin{split}\\
{OP} &= \frac{A^{3/2}A^{\--5/4}}{\left(B^{5/2}\// {A^{5/4}}\right) + 1}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}\\
Some sort of this modification can give a general conditioning of the eddy viscosity.\\

\section{Turbulent mean flow}

There is no definition on turbulent flow, but it has a number of characteristic
features (see Pope~\cite{pope:book} and Tennekes \& Lumley~\cite{tennekes:lumley}) such as:

{\bf I. Irregularity}. Turbulent flow is irregular, random and chaotic.  The flow consists
of a spectrum of different scales (eddy sizes).
We do not have any exact definition of an \emph{turbulent eddy}\marginpar{\bf turbulent eddy}, but
we suppose that it exists in a certain region in space for a certain time and that it is subsequently
destroyed (by the cascade process or by dissipation, see below).
It has a characteristic velocity and length (called a velocity and length scale). The region
covered by a large eddy may well enclose also smaller eddies.
The largest eddies are of the order of the flow geometry (i.e. boundary layer thickness,
jet width, etc).
At the other end of the spectra we have the smallest eddies
which are dissipated by viscous forces (stresses) into thermal energy resulting in a temperature increase. Even though
turbulence is chaotic it is deterministic and is described by the Navier-Stokes equations.

 $S=1.51$, $-0.27$ and $-0.09$. The flatness
are $F= 7.68$, $5.81$ and $2.77$.

\end{figure}


Consider the  probability density functions of the fluctuations. 
The second moment corresponds to the variance of the fluctuations (or the square of the RMS, i.e.
%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{v^{\prime 2}}= \int_{-\infty}^\infty v^{\prime 2} f(v') dv'
\end{equation*}
%
$\overline{v^{\prime 2}}$ is usually computed by integrating in time.



\section{Turbulent mean flow}

\subsection{Time averaged Navier-Stokes}

When the flow is turbulent it is preferable to decompose
the instantaneous variables (for example the velocity components and
the pressure) into a mean value and a fluctuating value, i.e.
%
\begin{equation}
\label{decomposition_eq}
%\begin{align}
\begin{split}
v_i &= \vb_i + v'_i \\
p &= \pb + p'
\end{split}
%\end{align}
\end{equation}
%
where the bar, $\bar{\cdot}$, denotes the time averaged value.
One reason why we decompose the variables is that
when we measure flow quantities we are usually interested
in their mean values rather than their time histories.
Another reason is that when we want to solve the Navier-Stokes
equation
numerically it would require a very fine grid to resolve all turbulent
scales and it would also require a fine resolution in time (turbulent
flow is always unsteady). 

The continuity equation and the Navier-Stokes equation for  incompressible flow  with constant
viscosity read
%
\begin{equation}
\label{cont_eq}
\begin{split}
\frac{\D v_i}{\D x_i} &= 0\\
\rho \frac{\D v_{i}}{\D t} + \rho \frac{\D v_i v_j}{\D x_j} &=
- \frac{\D p}{\D x_i} + \mu \frac{\D^2 v_i}{\D x_j\D x_j}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%

The gravitation term, $-\rho g_i$, has been omitted which means that the $p$ is the \emph{hydrostatic}
pressure.
Inserting Eq.~\ref{decomposition_eq} at p.~\pageref{decomposition_eq} into the continuity equation
(\ref{cont_eq}) and the Navier-Stokes equation we obtain
the \emph{time averaged} continuity equation and Navier-Stokes
equation
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{cont_time_eq}
\frac{\D  \vb_i}{\D x_i} &=& 0\\
\label{NS_time_eq}
\rho \frac{\D \vb_{i}}{\D t} + \rho \frac{\D \vb_i \vb_j}{\D x_j} &=&
- \frac{\D \pb}{\D x_i} + \frac{\D}{\D x_j}\left(\mu \frac{\D \vb_i}{\D x_j} - \rho \vij \right)
\end{eqnarray}

\label{closure}
This equation is the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equation and it is often called
the \emph{Reynolds equation}.\marginpar{\bf Reynolds\\equations}
A new term $\rho\vij$ appears on the right side of Eq.~\ref{NS_time_eq} which
is called the \emph{Reynolds stress tensor}. The tensor is symmetric
(for example $\overline{v'_1v'_2} = \overline{v'_2v'_1}$). It represents correlations
between fluctuating velocities. It is an additional stress term due to 
turbulence (fluctuating velocities) and it is unknown. We need a model
for $\vij$ to close the equation system in Eq.~\ref{NS_time_eq}.
This is called the \emph{closure problem}: the number of unknowns (ten:
\marginpar{\bf closure \\problem} three velocity components, pressure, six stresses) is
larger than the number of equations (four: the continuity equation and
three components of the Navier-Stokes equations).

\subsubsection{Boundary-layer approximation}

For steady  ($\D /\D t=0$), two-dimensional ($\vb_3 = \D /\D x_3=0$) boundary-layer type of flow (i.e. boundary layers
along a flat plate, channel flow, pipe flow, jet and wake flow, etc.) where
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{bound_layer_approx_eq}
\vb_2 \ll \vb_1, \; \frac{\D}{\D x_1} \ll \frac{\D}{\D x_2},
\end{eqnarray}
%
Eq.~\ref{NS_time_eq} reads
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{NS_time_eq_b}
\rho \frac{\D \vb_1 \vb_1}{\D x_1} + \rho \frac{\D \vb_2 \vb_1}{\D x_2}  &=&
- \frac{\D \pb}{\D x_1} + \frac{\D}{\D x_2}\underbrace{ \left[\mu \frac{\D \vb_1}{\D x_2}
 - \rho \overline{v'_1v'_2}\right]}_{\tau_{tot}} 
\end{eqnarray}
%
$x_1$  and  $x_2$ denote
the streamwise and wall-normal coordinate, respectively.
