\section{Results and discussion}
In this section the results of the simulations carried out will be presented and discussed. Two different variations of the LB solver have been tested. One with the different values of the relaxations parameters~\cite{•} and other with the all the relaxation parameters set equal to 1~\cite{•}. The former variation is considered and used for the further comparisons and the results of the latter variation will just be presented in the Appendix for the sake of completion. Firstly, the results of the LB simulations carried out without any turbulence modelling will be presented and discussed. The result of the simulations with no-model will be termed as the \emph{under resolved DNS (UDNS)}. Under resolved because the resolution is coarser compared to the reference mesh resolution and DNS because no additional modelling is done for turbulence. The DNS results of~\cite{kim:moin:moser:87} , for $Re_\tau = 395$, will be used as a reference for comparison. It will be followed by the discussion with the results from the LB-LES results of WALE model and will be compared with the UDNS and DNS results.
