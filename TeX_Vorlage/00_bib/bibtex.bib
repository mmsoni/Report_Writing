	abstract = "Abstract This work presents the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for computational simulations of the cardiac electrical activity using monodomain model. An optimized implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method is presented which uses a collision model with multiple relaxation parameters in order to consider the anisotropy of the cardiac tissue. With focus on fast simulations of cardiac dynamics, due to the high level of parallelism present in the LBM, a \{GPU\} parallelization was performed and its performance was studied under regular and irregular three-dimensional domains. The results of our optimized lattice Boltzmann parallel implementation for cardiac simulations have shown acceleration factors as high as 500 √ó for the overall simulation and for the \{LBM\} a performance of 419 mega lattice updates per second was achieved. With near real time simulations in a single computer equipped with a modern \{GPU\} these results show that the proposed framework is a promising approach for application in a clinical workflow. "

@phdthesis{Havran2000:PhD,
	Abstract = {Global illumination research aiming at the photo-realistic
	
	 image synthesis pushes forward research in computer graphics as a
	
	 whole. The computation of visually plausible images is
	
	 time-consuming and far from being realtime at present. A significant
	
	 part of computation in global illumination algorithms involves
	
	 repetitive computing of visibility queries.
	
	 In the thesis, we describe our results in ray shooting, which is
	
	 a well-known problem in the field of visibility. The problem is
	
	 difficult in spite of its simple definition: For a given oriented
	
	 half-line and a set of objects, find out the first object
	
	 intersected by the half-line if such an object exists. A
	
	 na\"{\i}ve algorithm has the time complexity $O(N)$, where $N$
	
	 is the number of objects. The na\"{\i}ve algorithm is practically
	
	 inapplicable in global illumination applications for a scene with
	
	 a high number of objects, due its huge time requirements. In this
	
	 thesis we deal with heuristic ray shooting algorithms that use
	
	 additional spatial data structures. We put stress on average-case
	
	 complexity and we particularly investigate the ray shooting
	
	 algorithms based on spatial hierarchies. In the thesis we deal
	
	 with two major topics.
	
	 In the first part of the thesis, we introduce a ray shooting
	
	 computation model and performance model. Based on these two models
	
	 we develop a methodology for comparing various ray shooting
	
	 algorithms for a set of experiments performed on a set of
	
	 scenes. Consecutively, we compare common heuristic ray shooting
	
	 algorithms based on BSP trees, kd-trees, octrees, bounding volume
	
	 hierarchies, uniform grids, and three types of hierarchical grids
	
	 using a set of 30 scenes from Standard Procedural Database. We
	
	 show that for this set of scenes the ray shooting algorithm based
	
	 on the kd-tree is the winning candidate among all tested ray
	
	 shooting algorithms.
	
	 The second and major part of the thesis presents several
	
	 techniques for decreasing the time and space complexity for ray
	
	 shooting algorithms based on kd-tree. We deal with both kd-tree
	
	 construction and ray traversal algorithms. In the context of kd-tree
	
	 construction, we present new methods for adaptive construction of
	
	 the kd-tree using empty spatial regions in the scene, termination
	
	 criteria, general cost model for the kd-tree, and modified surface
	
	 area heuristics for a restricted set of rays. Further, we describe
	
	 a new version of the recursive ray traversal algorithm. In context
	
	 of the recursive ray traversal algorithm based on the kd-tree, we
	
	 develop the concept of the largest common traversal sequence. This
	
	 reduces the number of hierarchical traversal steps in the kd-tree
	
	 for certain ray sets. We also describe one technique closely related
	
	 to computer architecture, namely mapping kd-tree nodes to memory
	to
	
	 increase the cache hit ratio for processors with a large cache
	
	 line. Most of the techniques proposed in the thesis can be used in
	
	 combination. In practice, the average time complexity of the ray
	
	 shooting algorithms based on the kd-tree, as presented in this thesis,
	
	 is about $O(log N)$, where the hidden multiplicative factor
	
	 depends on the input data. However, at present it is not known
	
	 to have been proved theoretically for scenes with general
	
	 distribution of objects. For these reasons our findings are
	
	 supported by a set of experiments for the above-mentioned set of
	
	 30 scenes.},

	schemes, including the uniform space subdivision, octree and kd-tree.
	We use simple computational model , which assume that the objects
	are uniformly distributed in space. The efficiency is characterized
	by two measures, including the expected number of ray-object intersections
	needed to identified the first intersected object, and the expected
	number of steps on the space partitioning data structure. We can
	come to the interesting conclusion that these numbers are constant
	and are independent of the number of objects in the scene. The number
	of intersections is determined by how well the cells of the partitioning
	data structure enclose the objects. Such analysis helps to understand
	why kd-tree is better than octree and uniform space subdivision and
	provides hints to improve their implementation.},
