\textbf{Aufagbe 2}\\
\\
When ',' is placed outside the curly braces, than it is not considered as the argument that is passed to the command "opening". Thus it will be placed in the section "Letter body" and not in the opening section, as it is not considered as an argument.
But if it is placed in the braces, than it is considered as an argument to the command "opening" and it will included in the opening section.\\
